# social_harmeless

A simple try to create an Open Source Social Network in which you can share only images, only with your close friends.

This Project is made with Flutter and Firebase.

I dindn't refactor the code yet, so sorry for the mess.

At this stage is working the Login, the loading process and the display of images  to the user.

The problem is I haven't implemented yet the way to add friends and to show content only to friends.

The app will not work as it is since my firebase backend is close, you need to add yours.
